        When I look over my college career and see how much I was able to accomplish in such a short amount of time, sometimes I honestly can&rsquo;t believe it. As I have reflected upon my experience from my freshman year to the present day, I discovered a truth about myself that astonishes me every time I think about: I have never been so active and assertive in my education than I have been right now, and it has done wonders for me. The crazy part about it all is that it didn&rsquo;t even start at the University of Michigan. My freshman year at the University of Miami in many ways was an introduction to what was to come up until now. I was surrounded by a plethora of talented students and friends of whom I am still close with to this day. I learned how to be active and involved on campus by joining clubs like the African Student Association, Marine Mammal Rescue Team, or the Anime club. I also learned just how rigorous college studies could be with the courses I was taking in computer science and the Marine Science school. It&rsquo;s funny because many people ask me why I left Miami as if I didn&rsquo;t enjoy my time. I literally got the chance to ride on the back of a dolphin with my club. I mean, who in their right mind would leave Miami for Michigan? For me, however, it was more than just leaving the good weather. I always tell people I enjoyed my time at the U profoundly. I had an amazing experience there and if I never got that sophomore year transfer option, I would still be there right now doing just fine. At the end of the day, coming back to attend the University of Michigan was like it was meant to be. Maybe it the fact that it was my first choice anyway or that my parents were alumni that drilled the idea into my tiny skull as a child. Even then, having my Mom, Dad, and several of my aunts and uncles graduate from there is quite a legacy. Even my sister was there already! I had the foundation and all the support I could ever want. Yet still, it wasn&rsquo;t just because I had family there or that it was much closer to home. Having cheaper tuition also helped.  I came back home to attend this school because I wanted to. It was my decision at the end of the day and I have no regrets about it. I was destined to be here, and when I made the decision to transfer, I never looked back.&nbsp;

        Since I&rsquo;ve been here, I've learned more about my interests, the world and of myself than I could ever imagine. As a generally low-key person all my life, I learned just how sociable I could be and my confidence has never been higher. Just as I did in Miami, I joined clubs like the African Student Association, NSBE, MEECS(Minorites in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science), Animation Club, and Casual Gaming Club. I don't think I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of so many organizations in my life. I&rsquo;ve gotten to know so many amazing people and make so many friends over these last three years it astonishes me to this day. During my time here at Michigan, I also got my first ever internship at a company called Workday as a Software Application Engineer intern. I was so elated when I first heard I received the internship, but I was nervous and anxious as well. I didn&rsquo;t know at the time if I was up to par. I didn't know yet how I would adapt to being in a real job in the IT/tech world. Most of that doubt was also due to the fact that I was coming off two of my worst semesters back to back (computer science is no joke at all). With all the good that had been coming my way up to that point, I also learned many things the hard way. I was at my lowest point academically during that time before I got the internship. I&rsquo;d be lying if I said a part of me felt that I didn&rsquo;t deserve to get the position. However, what would happen afterward during that summer at Workday would change everything for me. I got there in Pleasanton, California and I absolutely loved it. The people I worked with on the Financials: Grants team at Workday were amazing and the other interns I met there were so talented and cool. I also performed well and the team loved what I was doing. They loved me so much so that they even offered me a chance to come back, which I did this past summer. The second summer that I was there, I was able to actually form a relationship between Workday and MEECS where they would set up a meeting for students in the organization and video call us. Outside of the project I was working on for my team, that was a monumental moment for me. Forming that relationship was so important because I wanted to create an opportunity where students of color who love computer science can get a taste of opportunities like internships/jobs, resume workshops, meetings with recruiters, and so much more. I want these students to have a fair shot, just as anyone else does. Those two summers that I was there is California, I learned that I belonged. I knew belonged in computer science and I belonged in the tech world. I knew I could see myself having a career in computer science and thrive in this world. That moment was a major turning point for me in my life.  When my internship was over, at that moment, I learned just how unique and great I can truly be. From that point on, nothing has stopped me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Now, I have grown to become that assertive student who takes control of his education and aspirations. In addition, I&rsquo;ve solidified another essential truth about myself as I&rsquo;ve evolved as a student and human being: I learned what my ultimate &ldquo;brand&rdquo; was. In the end, I can talk all day about coding, gaming, music, basketball, or any other of my many interests. However, what I love doing is lending a hand to those who were in similar circumstances to me. I know plenty of other people like me who want to achieve something, but they don&rsquo;t have the knowledge or resources to do so. Maybe they even don&rsquo;t know if they have the courage to do so. I know these feelings very well because I&rsquo;ve had them all my life. I know what it&rsquo;s like to not have the inside knowledge to opportunities like others do. I know what it&rsquo;s like to doubt your own abilities and unique talent. I know what it's like to have a dream and have feelings of fleeting courage on reaching that dream. I&rsquo;ve been there, and when those feelings came around, my safety net was my dad. He has always put in positions to be successful and utilize my skills to my advantage. He has always been that way and he still does. What makes his actions so inspirational for me is that he is like this with everyone. He was continuously kept my friends and even my sister's friends in the loop for opportunities that arise within their interests and studies. If the opportunity arises, he even helps them get in contact with people who can directly help them if he has the connections to do so. He does these things constantly with people in my family, his friends, and his colleagues. His ability to go out of his way to help others in their pursuits is what I am learning to do and striving to be.  Now, what I pride myself the most in is assisting other people like me, who've been in my shoes,  fully realize their goals.&nbsp; &nbsp;

        &nbsp;An example of this coming to fruition was at the end of my Junior Year, I was elected and am now serving as treasurer of the Advisory Council for Global Scholars Program. Now, I am working with other fantastic members to plan amazing events for all of the students in GSP. I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to meet new students in the program and form relationships with a number of them. Now, I'm in a great position to be a leader in the GSP community and be of service to them in case they ever need anything.  After my success in creating a partnership between Workday and MEECS, I am also now a part of their leadership. On top of the new leadership positions,  I&rsquo;ve also been active in applying for jobs and staying active in all of the organizations I was already a part of. To say I&rsquo;m living the college experience would be an understatement.

        &nbsp;To be where I am now in life and my education is a blessing. The fact that I am due to graduate in December 2020 still hasn&rsquo;t hit me yet. There is still work to be done, but with everything that has led me up to this point, I wouldn't have it any other way.  If I could sum up my education experience in a few words, I would say it was like &ldquo;Chaotic Tranquility&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s quite a paradox, but I think it sums up my experience so far. No matter what was happening in my academics or my life around me, I&rsquo;ve always remained calm and steady. That steadiness has helped me to stay confident in myself even at my lowest points and enabled me to improve. With all that I&rsquo;ve been through,  I can&rsquo;t wait to see where my life will be headed in the future. With my background in computer science and software engineering, I hope to one day get into the gaming industry and help create games which tell essential stories that will be long lasting. I also hope to fulfill my dream and build my own gaming studio. These are lofty goals that I know will take time to achieve. No matter what obstacles may lie ahead, I can sleep well at night knowing there are family, friends, colleagues, and people who I&rsquo;ve met during this journey so far that I can rely on. With all that I have been able to accomplish and with more to look forward to along the way, I can keep my head up and confidently move forward.&nbsp;
